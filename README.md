## [SDF10] API Learning Reflection ðŸ§ 

Welcome to the [SDF10] API Learning Reflection! Through this exercise, you will reflect on key concepts, practical experiences, and the tools you've encountered or used in API interactions.

1. **Understanding and Application**: Reflecting on the key concepts, can you explain in your own words what an API is and its significance in software development? Provide an example of how you have used or encountered an API in a project or a practical scenario.

It allows us to access data from one place to another. For example on my phone i make use of an Investing platform. The investing platform has an API that gets the data from the JSE which in turn reflects on my Investing platform updating the share values.

2. **Conceptual Distinctions**: How would you differentiate between an interface and an API? 

An interface is like what we see on our side like the website, end result of HTML and CSS. An API is more like software to softawre in the example above where one set of code makes use of another set of code or data.

3. **Components and Types of APIs**: Can you identify the main components of an API and describe their roles? Reflect on the different types of APIs mentioned (e.g., Web APIs, RESTful APIs) and discuss which type you find most intriguing or useful, and why.

You get the HTTP in which you enter a set of rules for transmitting files.A "X" specifies the method like GET,POST etc. You use the header to specify what language you want the data in, like a JSON format and the body is the data you get from the API.

4. **Practical Application and Tools**: Reflect on your experience with API exploration and implementation. Have you used any specific tools (such as Curl or API exploration tools) or libraries to interact with APIs? 

In the YouTube video I used the curl tool to get data from a specific artists albmumn, like the image or even the albumn or song name. We also did a very basic example directly to the URL to tell a dad joke as well as use jq to make it more readable.

5. **Learning and Improvement**: Considering the key concepts and your practical experiences, identify one area related to APIs where you feel confident and one area where you see a need for improvement. What steps will you take to enhance your understanding and skills in the area you wish to improve?

I personally feel i grasp the core concepts well and was able to follow along the practical examples in the video. I feel i need more practise and examples i can use within my own code. I will practise more with the different HTTP verbs. I want to make use of the dad jokes and built a website that generates jokes when clicked on.
